Project Title
Complexity Analysis and SARIMAX Prediction

Description
This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing the complexity of distinct values in various fields and predicting total calls for a day using the SARIMAX model based on internal and external indicators.

Files Included
Activity_Complexity.py: Script to analyze and compare the complexity of distinct values in activity fields.
Code_Complexity.py: Script to analyze the complexity of distinct values in code fields.
Type_Complexity.py: Script for complexity analysis of distinct values in type fields.
SARIMAX_Total_Calls.py: Script to predict the total number of calls for a day using the SARIMAX model, leveraging internal and external indicators.


Usage
These scripts can be used to:

Analyze the complexity of distinct values in specific fields (activity, code, type).
Predict daily total calls using time series analysis with SARIMAX.
